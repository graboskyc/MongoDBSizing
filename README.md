# MongoDB Sizing
This spreadsheet was originally built by [Jay Runkel](https://github.com/jayrunkel) for the MongoDB World 2017 Sizing Presentation. You can watch his talk by [clicking here](https://www.mongodb.com/presentations/sizing-mongodb-clusters).

This example follows a fake company's app, Planet$. Using this spreadsheet, you can roughly calculate sizing for MongoDB nodes.

I have modified this example to make it slightly simpler to use for more novice MongoDB users. All editable fields are in orange and the result of calculations are in green.
